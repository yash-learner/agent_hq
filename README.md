# Operator dashboard

Static, read-only projection of the `agent-hq-state` branch. Implements the
`Operator Dashboard.dc.html` design against
[`docs/dashboard-design-requirements.md`](../docs/dashboard-design-requirements.md).

No build step, no framework, no dependency. Four files ship:

| File | |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | shell, landmarks, per-deployment config |
| `app.js` | fetch, derive, render — DOM API only, no `innerHTML` |
| `markdown.js` | markdown → DOM for the artifact viewer; a deliberate subset, not CommonMark |
| `app.css` | component styles (the design carried these inline) |
| `tokens.css` | **vendored verbatim** from the Claude Design project — re-import, don't hand-edit |
| `fixture.json` | sample state for local development; it ships with the site but is only ever fetched on `localhost` |
| `.nojekyll` | tells Pages to serve the branch as-is — no Jekyll build, nothing to compile |

## Deploy

Pages serves the orphan **`gh-pages`** branch (Settings > Pages > Deploy from
a branch, `/ (root)`), whose root is a copy of this directory. No workflow
does it. After your change is merged, from an up-to-date `main`:

```bash
git push -f origin "$(git subtree split --prefix dashboard main):refs/heads/gh-pages"
```

`-f` is expected — the branch is derived output and is never edited by hand,
so a rewritten `main` should just re-derive it. Nothing else deploys: state
arrives at view time, so a state write neither triggers nor needs a deploy.

## Configure per deployment

One line in `index.html`:

```html
<meta name="agent-hq:engine-repo" content="yash-learner/agent_hq">
```

The engine repo must be **public** — that is what makes the state branch
readable without a token. On a private install the page fails closed with the
FETCH FAILED state and points at the `agent-hq` CLI, which is intended
(`docs/operations.md` §9).

## Run it locally

```bash
cd dashboard && python3 -m http.server 8099
open http://127.0.0.1:8099/index.html
```

On `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` the page reads `fixture.json` instead of the live
branch, so the whole UI is exercisable offline. The fixture deliberately
includes the awkward cases: a ticket with no `block_reason`, a run with
`usage_known: false`, `AWAITING_MERGE`, a five-attempt step, and the hostile
artifact string from `tests/fixtures/state/tickets/HQ-1/state.json`.

## Data contract

Fetches **one** document — `dashboard.json` at the root of the state branch:

```jsonc
{
  "generated_at": "2026-07-29T02:16:23Z",  // required: the staleness stamp
  "engine_repo": "owner/repo",             // optional: overrides the meta tag for links
  "tickets": [ /* whole ticket docs, exactly as tickets/<id>/state.json */ ],
  "health":  { /* health/latest.json verbatim */ }
}
```

`tickets` entries are the **unmodified** ticket documents (`schemas/state.schema.json`)
— the run chain, `work_repos`, `block_reason` and per-run `artifacts` are all
read from them. Nothing is precomputed server-side; every view is derived in
the browser.

`GitJsonStateStore.write()` emits this document on every state write
(`engine/dashboard.py`), so the projection is never staler than the branch.
`agent-hq dashboard --state <worktree>` rebuilds it by hand if a branch's
copy goes missing.

## Two rules the code holds to

**Every string in the data is untrusted** — ticket text, block reasons and
artifact paths come from issues and agent output. Nodes are built with
`createElement` + `textContent`; there is no `innerHTML` anywhere. Hrefs are
validated before they are trusted: a PR ref must match `owner/repo#N`, an
artifact path carrying a scheme, a `//` prefix or a `..` segment renders as
plain text rather than a link, and `--tone` is only ever set from a fixed
allowlist keyed by run state, never from data.

**Zero is not free.** `cost_usd: null` / `usage_known: false` means *unmetered*.
Those runs are excluded from every total and counted separately, and the spend
card says so in words.

## The artifact viewer

`?ticket=<id>&run=<run_id>&artifact=<path>` renders one ledger artifact in
place of the board — deep-linkable like the ticket detail. `.md` renders as
prose, images inline, other text as `<pre>`; anything else offers the raw link
and nothing more.

Markdown is rendered by `markdown.js` into **DOM nodes**, never an HTML
string. That is the whole reason it exists rather than `marked` or
`markdown-it`: both produce a string, and mounting a string means `innerHTML`,
which §4.4 forbids outright because artifact content is agent-written and the
least trusted data on the page. The subset covers what the task library emits
— headings, paragraphs, lists, fenced code, quotes, rules, pipe tables, and
inline code/emphasis/links/images. Unknown syntax renders as the literal text
it is.

Links and images inside an artifact go through the same resolver as
everything else: `http(s)` or a containable relative path, or it renders as
text. A `[click](javascript:…)` in a spec is characters on screen, never an
anchor. `tests/test_dashboard_assets.py` pins the no-HTML-string rule for
every file in this directory.

## Timestamps

Runs are **start**-timestamped only. `attempt_started_at`, `deadline` and
`gate_requested_at` exist; there is no completion time on a run, and events
carry no `ts` at all (`schemas/event.schema.json`). So an attempt reads
"started 4 days ago", not "finished 4 days ago" — the finish time isn't in
the ledger to render. Relative formatting is `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`, and
every relative label keeps the exact ISO value in its `title`.

## Deriving the run chain

The one model easy to get wrong. A logical step is `(parent_run_id, handoff_key)`;
`attempt` is the retry axis inside it (a retry reuses the key at a higher
attempt).

Steps are ordered by **`queue_seq`** — the ticket's stored queue position —
falling back to array index for runs written before that field, which is exactly
the order dispatch used then (mirrors `engine.engine.queue_positions`).

Neither of the two obvious alternatives works:

- **Not `chain_depth`.** One run can declare several queue entries at once, and
  they all sit at the declaring run's depth + 1. Depth ties across the whole
  declaration, so the tiebreak would decide the order.
- **Not array order.** A retry inherits the `queue_seq` of the attempt it
  replaces, so it can belong *earlier* in the queue than a run appended after
  that attempt failed.

`queue_seq` is not a row index and the same task appears many times, so nothing
here assumes a fixed task sequence.

A step in state `CANCELLED` is planned-then-dropped work: an entry a later run
removed from the queue before it ran. It renders as a step with a note rather
than being hidden — a route *changing* is the interesting part of the ledger,
and hiding it would make the queue look like it had always been the current
plan. Runs are never deleted.

`enqueued by` is `parent_run_id`; `read output of` is `input_from_run_id`, which
is a different run whenever one run declared several entries — the enqueuer of
`review` need not be the producer of what `review` consumed.

## Known gaps

- **320 px not verified.** The CSS is there (`auto-fit` grids, a 520 px
  breakpoint, `overflow-wrap: anywhere`) but the narrowest viewport actually
  rendered was the Chrome window minimum, ~500 px.
- **No "finished N minutes ago".** Nothing in the ledger records when a run
  ended (see Timestamps). Adding `finished_at` to the run record would be a
  small engine change and would also unlock cycle-time views.
- **No auto-refresh.** The stamp plus an explicit Refresh button is what the
  requirements ask for; `cache: 'reload'` is the strongest ask available and
  `raw.githubusercontent.com` still serves up to 5 minutes stale.
- Theme choice persists in `localStorage`. That is a per-user preference,
  which §6 lists as a non-goal — kept because the design ships a toggle and
  one that resets on every visit is worse than none.

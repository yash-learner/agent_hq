"""Pure queue-declaration validation (schemas/control.schema.json).

`validate_queue` checks a task's `.agent-hq/control.json` against the control
schema, then -- for a `queue` outcome -- each declared entry's artifact-path
containment and provenance. It takes no state-store or ticket-state input:
ledger existence, cancellation resolution, and the loop/budget guards all need
state and are enforced atomically in `apply_queue`, not here.

"""Three-phase runner + intake + the GitHub workflow dispatch API.

The runner drives one task run through three separately-invoked phases
(`prepare` / `execute` / `collect`), each an ISOLATED GitHub Actions job
(hardening plan Task 12): prepare and collect are credentialed
(`AGENT_HQ_TOKEN`); execute is credential-free (`permissions: {}`, only
`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`) and never touches the state store or a push
credential. State crosses the job boundary as plain files transported by
`actions/upload-artifact`/`download-artifact` (no custom tar), at
deterministic per-phase paths (`prepare_dir_for`/`execute_dir_for`):

  - **prepare** writes only the claim (`store.claim_run`) and binding, then
    `bundle.json` (prompt, tools, deadline, repo, base_commit, output_paths,
    and -- for a task whose prompt needs the parent diff -- `diff_base`/
    `diff_head` commit ids) plus the restored `run.input_artifacts` content
    (read from the source run's ledger namespace). Prepare has no work-repo
    clone -- it never runs `_write_parent_diff` itself, only passes commit
    ids.
  - **execute** clones the public repo at `base_commit` itself (no clone
    credential needed -- PD-5), materializes the transferred inputs,
    generates `.agent-hq/diff.patch` from `diff_base`/`diff_head` when the
    bundle requests it, runs the agent, and emits the work patch (excluding
    both `run.input_artifacts` and the declared outputs), the normalized
    `execute-result.json`, `control.json`, and the declared/input artifacts
    staged (containment-checked) into a staging directory. `.git` is never
    transferred.
  - **collect** parses `execute-result.json` FIRST -- on `failure` (incl. a
    normalized timeout) it does only failure/retry accounting and stops. On
    `success`, it re-validates the transported staging dir's containment,
    fresh-clones the repo, `git apply`s the work patch (a patch that fails
    to apply fails the run), lands it on the per-issue stable branch
    (`agent-hq/<issue-number>`, a plain fast-forward push using the
    recorded head as the lease), persists the ledger, and owns the
    create-or-get PR/gate/handoff bookkeeping.

`intake_ticket` reads eligibility from `config.projects["intake"]` (no more
`tasks/intake/` task -- intake is engine entry logic), rejects a public
deployment's ticket missing `public_safe_label` before any state/artifact
write, and enqueues `config.projects["initial_task"]` with the root run's
resolved repo on acceptance.

A task's own transition is driven entirely by its `.agent-hq/control.json`
outcome (`schemas/control.schema.json`) -- `queue` (validate + apply/gate; an
empty queue is "nothing further", which feeds queue-empty completion) or
`blocked` (ticket BLOCKED, escalate, no retry). A queue declaration may also
cancel pending entries. See `engine.handoff.validate_queue` and
`engine.engine.apply_queue`.

    left alone.

    Evidence lives in the ledger with the rest of a run's outputs, not in the
    work repo: it is QA output, not product code, and committing it to the PR
    branch would merge it into the product's history. The path is namespaced

    A file the run referenced but never produced becomes an explicit "missing"
    note instead of a URL -- `ledger` is what actually reached the ledger, so
    the check is against what exists, not what the agent claimed. A
    broken-image icon would read as an infrastructure glitch rather than as
    what it is: evidence that was never captured.

    When a sibling `.gif` exists for a referenced `.webm` (collect-derived
    presentation copy), the rewrite emits a blockquoted collapsed `<details>`
